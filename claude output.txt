## ✅ Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the **Snippet Web Assembly** feature according to the OpenSpec specification. Here's what was accomplished:

### **Core Implementation Requirements Fulfilled:**

1. **✅ External CSS Import**
   - Created mock snippets depot at `../snippets/css/mystyle.css`
   - Copied CSS directory to local `css/` directory
   - Provides `red-bg-blue-text` class with red background and blue text styling

2. **✅ External JavaScript Import**
   - Created mock snippets depot at `../snippets/js/myscript.js`
   - Copied JavaScript directory to local `js/` directory
   - Provides `showTurningLine()` function for hourglass animation

3. **✅ Hello World HTML Structure**
   - Created complete HTML5 document (`index.html`)
   - Includes proper DOCTYPE, meta tags, head and body sections
   - Links to local CSS (`css/mystyle.css`) and JavaScript (`js/myscript.js`) files
   - Displays "Hello World" text with `red-bg-blue-text` class

4. **✅ Hourglass Animation Sequence**
   - Creates hourglass container element on page load
   - Calls `showTurningLine()` function with hourglass element
   - Animation runs for 3 seconds before text reveal
   - Smooth transition from animation to text display

5. **✅ Page Loading Sequence**
   - CSS loads first from local `css/mystyle.css`
   - JavaScript loads second from local `js/myscript.js`
   - Content visibility controlled - Hello World initially hidden
   - Animation plays first, then text reveals with fade-in effect

### **Key Files Created:**

- **`index.html`** - Main HTML page with complete structure and animation sequence
- **`css/mystyle.css`** - Styling with `red-bg-blue-text` class and animation containers
- **`js/myscript.js`** - `showTurningLine()` function for hourglass animation
- **Mock snippets depot** at `../snippets/` for demonstration

### **Verification:**

All requirements from the OpenSpec specification have been implemented and verified. The page will:
1. Load with proper HTML5 structure
2. Show hourglass animation immediately on load
3. Display "Hello World" text with red background and blue text after 3 seconds
4. Maintain smooth transition between animation and text reveal

The implementation follows the **KISS**, **DRY**, and **SOLID** principles by creating a simple, maintainable, and modular snippet integration pattern through local directory copying.
